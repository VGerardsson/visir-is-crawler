        This site references the latest frontpage newspaper articles from
        several icelandic newspapers.

        The goal of this website it to help foreign students learning Icelandic
        find every day articles. It is also a useful learning ressource for
        teachers that need to select interesting articles for their students.

        When I started learning icelandic found useful ressources to start
        learning the language. But once I reached a certain level the available
        ressources were very rare. That is I why I decided to build this small
        website.I made this website especially for everyone that has been
        learning icelandic for a while but that find it difficult to find news
        that is at their level.
