        <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
       <i>ICELAND FRÉTTIR</i> is an e-learning ressource for everyone learning
        icelandic. Frontpage news is freshly collected every day from different
        icelandic newspapers. The difficulty level of every piece is depicted
        right next to it. This will help students find suitable articles at
        their own level.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal of this website it to help foreign students learning Icelandic
        find every day articles. It is also a useful learning ressource for
        teachers that need to select interesting articles for their students.
      </p>
      <h3>DIFFICULTY LEVELS</h3>
      <p>
        The news is indexed on a daily basis to allow students to stay
        up-to-date with what is happening in Iceland within the limits of their
        individual reading comprehension. The difficulty level is determined by
        the Automated Readability (AR)-Index. For more information on this
        indexation method please check out Wikipedia
        <a
          target="_blank"
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_readability_index"
          >here</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        The estimated <b>AR-Index</b> values shown in the following table are
        compared to different age and language levels. The language levels
        <b>A1</b> to <b>C2</b> correspond to <b>CEFR</b>-levels (Common European
        Framework of Reference for Languages).
      </p>
      <p>
        The numbers for the estimated active vocabulary and the age of native
        speakers are taken from different sources. The vocabulary used in real
        life by different age groups varies tremendously. This table shows the
        averaged values of those sources. The actual numbers that you can find
        elsewhere for the age groups and vocabulary size and will not be the
        same as the statistics given here.
